According to a least one recent peer-reviewed paper [~20230311], there are maybe rough "clusters" of long covid symptoms. One cluster is maybe characterized by breathing difficulties (tight chest, painful chest, the experience of respiratory depression), insomnia, and anxiety (and things maybe common to other clusters like low-energy, brain fog, fatigue, and post-exertional malaise).

The above and what follows is not medical advice. Underlying conditions can look like long covid and be exposed by long covid. Please see a doctor if you have concerning symptoms to rule out and treat everything you can. Additionally, please look into diet, supplementation, peer and family support, the latest research, online communities of practice, everything, as you have desire and energy for. And this is an experimental, incomplete, and draft document.

At least at the time of this writing [~20230311], I'm not a huge fan of jhana, though I think at least "ad-hoc" and "bespoke" altered states are very important for meditative progress.

That said, breathing, sleep, and anxiety issues seem maybe tailor-made for jhana potentially being helpful, as sort of attractor states for useful feedback---jhana can potentially increase safe tolerance for hypoxia and hypercarbia, help to untangle snarls in autogenic and volitional breathing patterns, possibly be relatively more restorative than other states, in some ways, when sleep is hard to come by or other activities are too mentally or physically exertional, and, ***importantly, generally may help the autonomic nervous system gradually learn a larger felt "envelope of safety" so that it relies less on adrenaline and catecholimines as safety responses.***

(I'm not a buddhist scholar or a meditation scholar, but it's my impression that, in addition to a synergistic meditative tool, jhana was used classically as temporary relief from challenging mental and physical experiences.)

Do note, any sort of "deep" state, as well as some kinds of structured breathing, may be useful along the above dimensions as well. So it doesn't have to be jhana or this material that you turn to or anything at all. And, things like choiceless awareness and really any meditative tool can potentialy be useful for sort of untangling (old and new) disordered breathing, explore deep safety, over time, and so on.

Any powerful tool can tangle as well as untangle, so it's important to be patient and gentle and experimental, if you're unsure of something and low on resources, to turn to other tools or to take a break and just rest as best you can or watch netflix, if you have the brainpower, and so on, or call someone just to talk, if it's not the middle of the night, or call a friend on the other side of the world if it is---better to stop and wait and see than to possibly tangle further.

Learning jhana should sort of be "(almost) always downhill, always path of least resistance, always gently inclining or surrendering towards effortlessness." Will and effort are yellow flags, grinding and jamming are yellow flags. If there is resistance there is force hiding somewhere and vice versa, so the goal is sort of to never feel resistance and to sort of gently back away and try something else (maybe a very slight change) if there's even the initial ghost of resistance.

Anxiety can be very "physiological" and it can also be sort of very "specific," and it can also be mixed. See here for additional ways to explore anxiety:

Generally, the ability to enter jhanic states is entangled with gently, over time, getting one's entire life in order, and doing that in the right, gentle, no-rush order. You are sort of in a partnership with your bodymind to negotiate together the safety of entering jhana (as well as learning how to do it). So, if you are sitting down to practice, and you're five minutes in, or zero minutes in, and suddenly you find yourself doing chores (or surfing the internet), or reminded of something you need to do, those might be exactly the right things to do or the right thing to be reminded of. Untangling all, and what to do when, and when to think about or remember things or do things, and in what order, is part of the process of learning.

It's important to mix in other tools and no tools, as needed.

At least at this time, I don't actually teach jhana and I am neither classically trained or qualified to teach jhana. Please seek the advice of experienced jhanic practioners and teachers as makes feels right to you.

## a larger felt "envelope of safety" so that the bodymind relies less on adrenaline and catecholimines as safety responses

One could make a distinction between, on the one hand, white-knuckling and teeth-gritting, and, on the other hand "actually looking." This is not a moralizing distinction. One only "actually looks / actually sees" when it's all-the-way-down believed-/&#8203;felt-safe to do so. That is real looking, made out of tiny little steps of progressive real looking, one after another, and it is spontaneous and effortless; it just happens, it happens *for* you.

You can definitely take actions, help, around the edges, you can gently encourage, keep-company, suggest, nonverbally, or dialogue, or gently, provisionally, surrenderingly, participatingly negotiate or bargain with the bodymind. You can do things bobbo initiate gentle proximal experiments; gently, temporarily, experimentally, briefly, temporarily, maintain ground within a zone of tolerable discomfort or tolerable uncertainty. "If it's safe, if it's not *mean*, if it's not self-hateful, if loving, let it hurt, let it scream, the horror happens... ...and see what happens."
let horror, let the *self-acceptable* possibility of disaster unfold...

That last mile, that last moment just happens, though, when it's ready. It's sometimes just fine, pleasant, sometimes really scary, really unpleasant, sometimes even hellish, on and off, until then, and then "oh" or "oh!"

## internal, external, self-compassionate epistemics

This isn't just an "internal" thing---sometimes it can be *unhelpful* to read up on things, to google "\<horrible thing\> reddit," without the quotes, heh, and sometimes it can be *helpful* (oh, that is a good [horrifying!] explanation, but, maybe, and I'm a little closer to understanding, maybe") and sometimes it's a mixed bag or it's initially uncertain. But, generally, knowledge is power. If something is scary, long-run, it can often be helpful to read about it, to learn from other people's experiences, etc. If one is going "external" (and for "internal," too), ---epistemic hygiene--- yes people who have the worst of it never post or never come back, but also people for whom things went just fine ...

Notes for incorporation:

Prospective and retrospective engagement when you're there with what happens when you're not there. 

Just a little, just a little, too much is too much, there is always a little less ever slighter

The implications, the expectations

Participating in that 

Oh. *Oh.*

Titration, just to the edge. You'll accidentally go past at first, too far at first, too much at first, that won't work, then back, then just a little (you won't know how at first), then just a little, there's the edge, that's not too much, learning occurs, there.


## Tower-of-hanoi parallelizable safe reversibilities

Apologies if I generate some insight porn here but it ends up not being the best way to look at this. There's lots of lindy (time-tested) material out there.

The way I'm thinking about this right now is something like concentration involves "some things not coming up." For that to happen, the system needs to deem that to be "safe." (And when I say "system," I don't mean to imply "essence" or anything "extra," or, with respect to "deem" that there's necessarily anything like "belief" or "deliberation" or "decisionmaking" going on.)

Given something like "layering theory" where "layering" is something like a change that blocks some underlying lability where that change has to be undone (delayered) for the underlying thing to become labile again, one basically want to accumulate non-layered reversibilities, where they system can choose to not attend to something but in a way where it's easy to once again attend to it, at the right time, as needed. If it's possible to attend to it, once again, at the right time, as needed, then it's safe to not attend to it. And so if you a bunch of those are accumulated in parallel, then *whoosh*, state change (e.g. a concentration state).

Now accumulating all those parallelizable safe reversibilities is a puzzle, hence tower-of-hanoi.
